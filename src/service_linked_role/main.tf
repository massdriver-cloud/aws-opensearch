# The linked service role can only be created once per account. This is conditionally created if it doesnt not exist.

# Could this be solved with a custom_suffix? 
#   No. Elasticsearch service and OpenSearch service both do _not_ support custom suffix.

# This step is skipped during decommission to preserve the service role.
#   The module that creates the role needs to know if it created it before the count is set ...
#   if this root module creates it, then checks data, it says its created, so the count is now 0 and it deletes it, thus we cache
#   But if we cache and this module is deleted, no other module will make it because _they also cache_.
